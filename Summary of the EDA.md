## **Summary of the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

**1\. Data Loading and Inspection:**

* The dataset (`full_data_set_merged.csv`) was loaded, and the date column (`DATE`) was converted to the appropriate datetime format.  
* Basic information about the dataset, including data types and missing values, was displayed. Any invalid dates were handled appropriately.

**2\. Time Series Visualization:**

* **Economic Indicators:** Time series plots were generated to visualize the trends and patterns of the economic indicators (e.g., `PRICE_PER_GALLON`, `UNEMPLOYMENT_RATE`, `INTEREST_RATES`) over time.  
* **Housing Prices:** A sample of housing prices for different regions was plotted over time to observe their behavior and potential seasonality.

**3\. Descriptive Statistics:**

* Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, min, max, quartiles, etc.) were calculated and displayed for the economic indicators, providing a statistical overview of their distributions.

**4\. Distribution Visualization:**

* **Histograms and Box Plots:** Histograms and box plots were generated for the economic indicators to visualize their distributions, identify potential skewness or outliers, and gain a better understanding of the data's central tendency and spread.

**5\. Correlation Analysis:**

* **Correlation Matrix and Heatmap:** A correlation matrix was calculated and visualized as a heatmap to identify the relationships (positive, negative, or weak) between the economic indicators. This helps in understanding how changes in one indicator might be related to changes in others.

* **Correlation with Target:** The correlation between the economic indicators and the selected target region's housing prices was also analyzed to identify potentially predictive features.

**6\. Pair Plot Visualization:**

* **Pairwise Relationships:** A pair plot was generated to visualize the relationships between all pairs of economic indicators. This provides a more detailed view of the correlations and potential interactions between features.

**7\. Target Region Selection:**

* The user was prompted to select a target region (* **selected Zipcode was 26869**) for housing price prediction, ensuring that the selected region is present in the dataset.

**8\. Target Variable Analysis (Scatter Plots):**

* **Feature vs. Target:** Scatter plots were generated to compare each economic indicator to the housing prices of the selected target region. This visualization helps assess the individual relationship and potential predictive power of each feature.

**Key Insights and Potential Observations (hypothetical):**

* **Time series plots** may reveal overall economic trends or seasonal patterns in housing prices.  
* **Histograms and box plots** could highlight data skewness, outliers, or unusual distributions in economic indicators.  
* **Correlation analysis** might show strong positive or negative correlations between specific indicators and housing prices, suggesting potential predictive relationships.  
* **Pair plots** may uncover further interactions or patterns among features.  
* **Scatter plots** would help visualize the relationship between each individual indicator and the target region's housing prices.

**Overall,** the EDA provides a comprehensive understanding of the dataset, identifying potential patterns, relationships, and insights that can inform feature selection, model development, and ultimately, housing price prediction.
